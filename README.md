This is the README file for the `perl-Workflow-Inotify' project. 

# Description

This project implements a very simple workflow for executing a process
when a file is written to a directory.  This model is appropriate for
a variety of processes that you might want to implement:

* process a file that is sent via FTP
* process a file that is uploaded to a web server
* move a file along a pipelined process

# Details

Try `man inotify`
